## About

HideWithCanvasVRC is a VRChat mod that allows users to hide their VRChat window with a canvas element. This way, people can keep others on the outside from seeing what they're doing in-game, without having to unfocus their window.

## How to Use

Simple really, all that you need to do is install the mod, and then it just works!

**This mod depends on UIExpansionKit**

*It will not run without it*

Once in-game, if you open your quick menu, at the bottom, you'll see the UiExpansionKit panel, and there'll probably be several buttons in there. One button will be labeled `Toggle Canvas`, hitting that button will toggle the Canvas on and off.

On the outside, viewers will be able to hit the **F5** button, and a sound in-game will play, letting you know someone would like to see your screen.

*This is still currently being worked on and more notification-centered features will be added down the line*

## Customization

In the releases section, a .unitypackage is bundled with it. THis unitypackage is the "template" for the canvas. It is packaged with the AssetBundle Manager package in Unity.

You can see a guide on how to get started with customization [here](https://github.com/200Tigersbloxed/UnityMods/blob/main/HideWithCanvasVRC/CUSTOMIZATION.md)!

# ATTENTION

It is *against* the VRChat ToS to modify your client in **any way, shape, or form**. By using this mod, you agree that your account may be *suspended* or *deleted*!

So don't be stupid and use this mod while streaming, there's currently no streamer mod toggle/detection ;)
